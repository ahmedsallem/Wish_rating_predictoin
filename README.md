the answer of this questions in the kaggle2 notebook 

✔️ Problem Formulation:
Define the problem. What is the input? What is the output? What data mining function is required? What could be the challenges? What is the impact? What is an ideal solution?
(You can put your answers in markdown format in your notebook - Text Cell)

✔️ Document your code:
Put detailed comment on each line of the code to show your understanding of the your code. Also describe: What is the experimental protocol used and how was it carried out? What preprocessing steps are used?

✔️ Model Tuning and Documentation:
Now based on the template, try to improve the model's performance on the public leaderboard by following the data science life-cycle for tuning. You can try different features, different hyperparameters/configurations of the model, and even a different model. For each trial, document the reason why you want to make the certain change and the expected outcome, before running the code. Record the observed performance and your thought on it. The final result is not important, but the process is. Documentation of your thought process is very important, since most people forgot why they test certain model/hyperparameter after they got the result (it takes time). It also helps a lot when you got stuck. You can organize the notebook by listing

thoughts and observations for trial 0, plan for trial 1
code for trial 1
thoughts and observations for trial 1, plan for trial 2
code for trial 2
…
You have to tune at least 5 times. All the tried solutions should be different (e.g. different feature sets/different preprocessing). Requirements:

Tried decision tree model with at least 2 different configurations/hyper-parameters
Tried SVM model with at least 2 different configurations/hyper-parameters
Tried Naive Bayesian model.
